## NO LONGER MAINTAINED (got bored of the project and i lacked ideas)
# Nightmode

Nightmode is a collection of random ideas i got while playing with my friends on a private server
**Functionalities so far**
- Events (Facility blackout, speedrun) 
- Broadcast from the game console 
- Vanish 
- Lots of tiny QoL to come (infinite radio is one)
- "Minigames" (flip a coin to get a random item)
- Some client side commands

**For now this plugin is very rudimentary and it'll probably constantly be updated as issues and ideas pop up**

**EXILED version**
- **8.12.2** (Most of the time the mod will be on the latest version of exiled)

**THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES!** 
- Depends on the AudioSystem plugin and its dependencies

Its my first time making any of my coding projects public (apart for some archived ones that went nowhere) any feedback and criticism is greatly appreciated!
