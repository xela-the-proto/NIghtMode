# Nightmode

Nightmode is a collection of random ideas i got while playing with my friends on a private server
**Functionalities so far**
- Events (Facility blackout) ~~that will be automated down the line~~
- Broadcast from the game console 
- Vanish (WIP its very rudimental as it is right now)
- Lots of tiny QoL to come (infinite radio is one)
- "Minigames" (flip a coin to get a random item)
- Change the color of all rooms in the facility with one command
- Some client side commands

**For now this plugin is very rudimentary and it'll probably constantly be updated as issues and ideas pop up**

**EXILED version**
- **8.11.0** (Most of the time the mod will be on the latest version of exiled)

**Additional info**
**THIS MOD HAS DEPENDENCIES!** 
- Depends on the AudioSystem plugin and its dependencies

Its my first time making any of my coding projects public (apart for some archived ones that went nowhere) any feedback and criticism is greatly appreciated!
